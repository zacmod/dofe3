      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly getting better at running, however shortly after the last recorded run my parents became ill with a non-covid related illness and I have not been able to run. Despite this my bouldering and parkour sessions have started again which is good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This details the first 5 run/rows of mine since I made the my 3dofe website. I struggled to keep my self motivated and still now. That being said, I always feel better for having done a run and will continue after dofe is over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
