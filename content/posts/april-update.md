I am increasingly getting better at running, however shortly after the last recorded run my parents became ill with a non-covid related illness and I have not been able to run. Despite this my bouldering and parkour sessions have started again which is good.

### 21 of march 2021 
It was a good yet muddy run. Had to walk through some particularly soggy areas to avoid falls.
